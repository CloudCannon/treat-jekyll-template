  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 cup unsalted butter
    * 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    * 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
    * 3 cups of sugar
    * 2 teaspoons of lemon zest
    * 6 teaspoons of lemon juice
    * 6 eggs
    * 1 cup Greek yogurt
    * 1 cup confectioners’ sugar
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Heat oven to 325° F. Butter and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
    2. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and lemon zest on medium-high until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice, then the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
    3. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add half the flour mixture, then the yogurt, and then the remaining flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).
    4. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 30 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
    5. In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and 1 of the remaining tablespoons of lemon juice until smooth, adding the remaining lemon juice as necessary to create a thick, but pourable glaze.
