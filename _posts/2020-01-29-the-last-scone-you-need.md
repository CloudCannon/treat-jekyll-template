  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grate 8 tbsp butter and place in freezer. Melt
       remaining butter. Place variant fruit in freezer (e.g. blueberries).

    2. Whisk together sour cream and milk. Refridgerate wet ingredients.
    3. Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Now is
       the time to add any non-chunky variant ingredients, such as zest.  Add
       frozen butter and toss with hands so butter is thoroughly coated.
    3. Add wet ingredients to dry. Fold with a spatula until just combined.
       Transfer to a liberally floured work surface and kneed dough just 6 to 8
       times.
    4. Roll dough into a 12 inch square. Fold dough into thirds, using a bench
       scraper to release the sticky dough. Fold into thirds again to form a
       four-by-four square. Transfer dough to floured plate and place in freezer
       for 5 minutes.
    5. On a floured work surface, roll dough again into a 12 inch square. Add
       your chunky ingredients and lightly press into the dough to keep them
       from rolling around. Using the bench scraper, loosen dough and roll into
       a log. Roll the dough into a 4 by 12 inch rectangle. Divide dough into 4
       inch squares and then cut each square in half on the diagonal. Place on a
       parchment-lined baking sheet.
    6. Brush the tops of the scones with butter and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
    7. Bake until golden brown streaks apeear, about 18-25 minutes. Transfer to
       cooling rack for 10 minutes (or eat straight away, who the F cares??).

Importantly, this recipe is a mere base for many flavor combinations. We provide
the recipe here for a few legendary variants such as lemon blueberry and orange
chocolate chip, but feel free make cheesy tuna scones, or celery scones, you
sick duck.

### Variants
So, you have a scone, but a plain scone is boring so we need to spice it up -
add some zing.
