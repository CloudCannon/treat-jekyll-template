## Chocolate Cupcakes with Vanilla Frosting

&nbsp;

* **&nbsp;Prep Time:**&nbsp;25 minutes
* **&nbsp;Cook Time:**&nbsp;20 minutes
* **&nbsp;Total Time:**&nbsp;3 hours, 25 minutes
* **&nbsp;Yield:**&nbsp;12-14 cupcakes

### Description

*Made from simple everyday ingredients, these chocolate cupcakes with vanilla frosting will be your new favorite. For best results, use natural cocoa powder and buttermilk.*

### Ingredients

* 3/4 cup (95g)&nbsp;**all-purpose flour**&nbsp;(spoon & leveled)
* 1/2 cup (45g)&nbsp;**unsweetened natural cocoa powder**
* 3/4 teaspoon&nbsp;**baking powder**
* 1/2 teaspoon&nbsp;**baking soda**
* 1/4 teaspoon&nbsp;**salt**
* 2 large&nbsp;**eggs**, at room temperature\*
* 1/2 cup (100g)&nbsp;**granulated sugar**
* 1/2 cup (100g) packed light&nbsp;**brown sugar**
* 1/3 cup (80ml) vegetable or canola&nbsp;**oil**&nbsp;(or melted coconut oil)
* 2 teaspoons&nbsp;**pure vanilla extract**
* 1/2 cup (120ml)&nbsp;**buttermilk**, at room temperature\*

#### Topping

* Chocolate Buttercream or Vanilla Buttercream
* **sprinkles**&nbsp;(optional)

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (177&deg;C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. Line a second pan with 2 liners – this recipe makes about 14 cupcakes. Set aside.
2. **Cupcakes:**&nbsp;Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla together until combined. Pour half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Then half of the buttermilk. Gently whisk for a few seconds. Repeat with the remaining wet ingredients and buttermilk. Stir until \*just\* combined; do not overmix. The batter will be thin.
3. Pour or spoon the batter into the liners. Fill&nbsp;**only halfway**&nbsp;(this is imperative\! only halfway\!) to avoid spilling over the sides or sinking.
4. Bake for 18-21 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting. I usually let them cool in the pan.
5. Frost cooled cupcakes however you’d like. I used chocolate buttercream and Wilton 1M piping tip for these pictured cupcakes. Top with sprinkles, if desired. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
